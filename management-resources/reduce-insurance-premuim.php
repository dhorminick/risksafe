                      The cost of your business insurance is largely determined
                      by your business’ risk factors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                      Many of the risks that could edge your business into a
                      higher premium bracket can be minimized, reassuring your
                      insurance company about your reduced level of risk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                      As work environments become safer, the number of workers’
                      compensation claims continues to decline. By performing
                      regular safety checks and reinforcing safe working
                      behavior of employees, you can eliminate hazards that
                      cause injuries and reduce workers compensation premiums.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                      Many insurance policies require you to take active steps
                      to reduce risk. It’s important to understand and implement
                      these requirements. For example, a policy may specify
                      certain security and safety measures that must be in
                      place, such as maintaining alarm and sprinkler systems or
                      keeping codes secure. Failing to comply with these
                      conditions could invalidate your insurance.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                      Assess your risk regularly and demonstrate to your
                      insurance company that you are making an effort to prevent
                      problems before they happen. Insurance companies want to
                      know that you are aware of and trying to reduce your risk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                      Go armed with a risk assessment and speak to your
                      insurance broker about getting the right risks covered.
                      Your broker might learn something about your business they
                      didn’t know about!

                      Before signing up to any type of insurance policy, you
                      need to evaluate its suitability and value in terms of
                      your individual circumstances. Think about:
