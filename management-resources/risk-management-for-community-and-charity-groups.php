							<li>Forward and strategic planning are improved</li>
							<li>Goals are achieved successfully and demonstrate to its stakeholders including beneficiaries, donors, funders, employees and the general public risk are managed.</li>
						</ul> 
						<p>The responsibility for the management and control of a charity rests with the committee or trustee body and therefore their involvement in the key aspects of the risk management process is essential.  In all but the smallest charities, the trustees are likely to delegate elements of the risk management process to staff or professional advisers. The level of involvement should be such that the committee and trustees can demonstrate good governance with confidence.</p>
