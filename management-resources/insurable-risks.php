                      Insurance is a small part of the whole Risk Management
                      process. It allows your organization to receive financial
                      compensation in case of loss, but it doesn't prevent
                      incidents from happening. Insurance should be viewed as a
                      “safety net” rather than a preventive measure.

                      Identifying your risks and taking out the right insurance
                      will help protect your business from financial loss and
                      minimize exposure. Risks that have major consequences but
                      are unlikely to happen are often insurable.
