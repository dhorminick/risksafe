						<p>Insurance is a small part of the whole Risk Management process.  It allows your organisation to receive financial compensation in the case of loss through the operation of your organisation. However, it does not prevent an incident occurring. Insurance should be employed as a “safety net”in case of an incident.  It should be applied as a part of a comprehensive risk management strategy which aims to avoid, reduce and control risks. While it’s important to insure your business against major business risks, your first line of defence should always be risk management.</p> 
						<p>Once you identify all of your risks, taking out the right insurance will help protect your business from financial loss and minimise its exposure to certain risks.Risks that could have major consequences but are relatively unlikely to happen are often insurable.</p> 
						<p>Then there are the company killers. These risks can sink startups and corporate giants alike. The survival of your venture depends on your ability to identify and mitigate the company killers.</p>
						<p>Risk management refers to a broad range of mitigation strategies and insurance is just one of these strategies.</p> 
						<p>Here are a few common forms of insurance and the risks they cover:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Property &amp; Casualty Insurance can mitigate losses from fire, theft, and natural disasters;</li>
							<li>Key Executive Insurance can mitigate losses from the death or incapacitation of a management team member;</li>
							<li>Errors &amp; Omissions Insurance can mitigate lawsuits from disgruntled customers; and</li>
							<li>Directors &amp; Officers Insurance can mitigate lawsuits in cases of negligence, harassment, or discrimination.</li>
							<li>Public liability insurance - Public liability insurance should cover you and your business against the financial risk of being found liable to a third party for death or injury, loss or damage of property or economic loss resulting from the business's or your negligence.</li>
							<li>Worker's compensation insurance - In Australia, it is compulsory to maintain appropriate accident and sickness insurance for all employees and certain contractors you engage in your business.</li>
							<li>Personal accident and illness insurance - This insurance is important if you are self-employed and not covered by workers' compensation insurance.</li>
							<li>Motor vehicle insurance - It is compulsory to insure all your business vehicles for third party injury liability.</li>
							<li>Burglary cover - Business assets should be protected against burglary by this type of insurance.</li>
							<li>Professional indemnity insurance - This type of insurance is important if your business involves providing  professional advice.</li>
							<li>Fidelity guarantee - Losses resulting from misappropriating by employees who embezzle or steal should be covered by this insurance.</li>
							<li>Machinery breakdown insurance - This insurance should cover your business for any losses incurred if plant and machinery break down.</li>
							<li>Product liability insurance - This insurance provides cover for injury or damage caused by goods your business sells, supplies or delivers - even in the form of repairs or services.</li>
